# WSPR-zero Project

The WSPR-zero project aims to provide a very small footprint, cost-effective, and ultra-portable solution for transmitting WSPR signals.
The project brings together various community contributions into an easy-to-install package tailored for the Raspberry Pi Zero, although it is also tested on the Raspberry Pi 3 & 4.

Enjoy!

## About WSPR

**WSPR** (pronounced "whisper") stands for Weak Signal Propagation Reporter. 
The WSPR-zero project empowers radio enthusiasts (nerds?) to transmit low-power signals globally, testing radio wave propagation by bouncing off the ionosphere. Designed for portability and efficiency, this project is perfectly suited for outdoor activities such as backpacking and traveling, thanks to its compact size and minimal power requirements.

Adding to the fun, every WSPR transmission ever sent or received—is logged to a massive database and is available for download, providing a great dataset for budding data analysts!

WSPR-zero’s open-source nature allows users to dive into the Linux-based system, offering hands-on opportunities to tweak both the software and hardware. This level of accessibility not only enhances learning but also invites innovation and customization, making it a fun project for tech enthusiasts (nerds?) who love to tinker with technology.

Each WSPR transmission is 110.6 seconds long. This precise duration allows for a slow data rate that enhances the likelihood of reception under weak signal conditions. The remaining time within the two-minute interval (about 9.4 seconds) is used as a buffer to ensure that transmissions do not overlap and that there is time for transceivers to switch from transmit to receive mode, and vice versa.

**Crazy stat:** Each WSPR transmission contains just 40.5 bytes of data at the impressively low rate of 1.46 baud!

### Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Zero, Pi 3 or Pi 4 (not yet tested on Pi 5)
- WSPR-zero or TAPR.org HAT (for transmission)
- RTL-SDR USB device (for receiving)
- HDMI dummy load dongle (prevents crashing upon transmission on Raspberry Pi Zero)
- Antenna of some sort. Simple half dipole wire antenna is easy, cheap and works great!
- Optional: UPS-Lite board for graceful shutdown when external and UPS-Lite batteries expire

### Features

- **Compatibility**: Primarily developed for the Pi Zero but also works on Pi 3 & 4.
- **Cost-Effective**: The total cost of the setup ranges from $40 - $80, depending on the antenna used.
- **WSPR-zero Filter Hat**: Developed by Outside Open, based on a filter by TAPR (tapr.org), but redesigned to comply with standard Raspberry Pi HAT specifications. This board helps filter out the noisy RF generated by the Pi.
- **Transmission Modes**: Includes both transmit and receive modes.
  - **Transmit**: Requires a WSPR-zero or TAPR Reapberry Pi hat.
  - **Receive**: Requires an RTL-SDR USB device.
- **Extended Run Time**: Can easily run for over 24 hours on a portable phone battery pack.

### Coming in V2
- **Real Time Clock Headers**
WSPR relies heavily on accurate time synchronization. Transmitters and receivers must have their clocks synchronized to Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) to within a second or so. This synchronization is critical because slight timing offsets can lead to missed transmissions or failure to decode signals properly.
- **Install Scripts**
Scripts to help newcomers get started with minimal effort.

## Installation
No install script yet - pull the repo and go from there :)

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is up to date and connected to the internet before starting the installation.
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install rtl-sdr librtlsdr-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfftw3-dev
```
### SSH Configuration
If SSH access is painfully slow, run the following command on the Pi
**Add IPQoS to sshd_config**:
```
echo "IPQoS 0x00" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
